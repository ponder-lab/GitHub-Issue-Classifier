### Setup:
1) Ensure Python `3.9.1` and corrosponding pip `3.9` are installed
2) Install requirements: `pip3.9 install -r requirements.txt`
   - Part of the script also relies on downloading stop word dictionaries.
   - Download `nltk` stop words if the script throws and error by uncommenting
     `nltk.download('wordnet')` and `nltk.download('stopwords'` in `commentProcessor.py`
3) Add a GitHub Personal Access Token in the access token file: `access_token.json`. Replace `<YOUR_GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN>` with your token.
   
Instructions on how to create a GitHub Personal Access Token: https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token
 
### Run:
Run the `main.py` script: `python3.9 main.py` to start up the interface.

### Test
1) Ensure that `pytest` is properly set up for your python `3.9` env.
2) Simply run `pytest` to check that all tests are passing.

### Folder Structure
`/utils` - Contains utility function files, such as IO, filtering results and processing comments

`/test` - Contains test file being ran by `pytest`

`/result` - Folder to output result files to. Contains a `.gitignore` to ignore all files in this folder to prevent results from being committed

`/config` - Contains configuration files for the app to run, such as the personal access token.
